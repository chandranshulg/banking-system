# Java Banking System

This is a simple banking system application built using Java. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, transfer funds between accounts, and check their account balances.

## Overview

The Java Banking System provides a console-based interface where users can perform basic banking operations. The application uses a `HashMap` to store and manage multiple accounts, each identified by a unique account number. Users can create new accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, transfer money to other accounts, and check their account balances through a menu-driven interface.
